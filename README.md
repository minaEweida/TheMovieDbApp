# TheMovieDbApp

This is a sample android app that gets latest movies using TMDB Api https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

Implementation is done using MVP pattern, Dagger2, Retrofit

To run the app, Sign up at https://www.themoviedb.org/ and get your api key and add it in your strings.xml file as follows:
```<string name="TMDB_API_KEY">YOUR_API_KEY</string>```

Future work: Changing the implementation to use RxJava2
